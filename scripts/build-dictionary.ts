 * The cleanest romanisation carrying every `wanted` tag.
 *
 * kaikki's Mandarin pinyin needs two rounds of cleaning, and 板 shows both. Its
 * ['Mandarin','Pinyin'] elements are:
 *
 *   'bǎn (ban³)'  Standard, Pinyin          ← standard reading, dirty
 *   'ban³'        Chengdu, Sichuanese       ← a DIALECT, and it looks clean
 *   'bàn'         Xi'an                     ← a dialect
 *   'bǎn'         Nanjing                   ← a dialect
 *   'bǎn'         Standard-Chinese, Pinyin  ← what we want
 *
 * So a bare tag match is not enough: the caller tries `Standard-Chinese` first.
 * Within a tier, a value with no parentheses is the clean one, and the
 * parenthesised tone gloss is stripped only when every candidate carries it.
 * `rejectPronunciationPattern` then drops tone-NUMBER schemes outright, so a
 * dialect or Wade-Giles form cannot win the last tier by looking clean.
