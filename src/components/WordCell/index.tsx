              Out of flow (ja): ruby layout widens the BASE to fit the
              annotation, so 勉強 drew as 勉 強 while its neighbours stayed
              tight. Kana is no wider than its kanji, so taking it out of flow
              costs nothing and keeps every word its own width.

              In flow (zh): pinyin IS wider than its hanzi. chángcháng needs more
              room than 常常 has, so out of flow it collided with the word
              beside it. Letting the browser widen the base is correct here.

              0.58em, not the browser default of 0.5: a tone mark or a small
              kana needs the extra pixel at body size. `select-none` is what
              keeps the reading out of a copied selection. */}
